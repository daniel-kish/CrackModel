# Crack Growth Model

## About
This project is dedicated to crack growth simulation. Developed in the main course of work on bachelor thesis (defended in Jun,2015). In the thesis itself a **Microsoft Azure** cloud application is developed which leverages massive parallel compute resources for batch processing of the crack simulations. The thesis app is to be found here. 
## Rationale
The **model** simulates crack development in a material under **cyclic load in hydrogen aggressive media**. Hydrogen embrittlement is known to cause failure of a metal sample under static loads. Furthermore, when HydEmb is considered to work *together* with cyclic load it significantly shortens componentâ€™s durability, that is estimation of its life found with fatigue cracking models is usually bigger than the more accurate one. This model helps to predict durability of a given sample with a relatively high accuracy taking into account (mode 1) only hydrogen embrittlement with statis load or (mode 2) both cyclic load and HydEmb.

The theoretical premises of the modelling technique implemented here, as well as thorough treatment of the subject can be found in the following papers:

##Results
In depth analysis of the model and its application are discussed in mentioned papers (above). Some of the results can be found visually pleasing so I just place some plots here.
