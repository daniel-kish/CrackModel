# Crack Growth Model

## About
This project is dedicated to crack growth simulation. Developed in the main course of work on bachelor thesis (defended in Jun,2015). 
## Rationale
The **model** simulates crack development in a material under **cyclic load in hydrogen aggressive media**. Hydrogen embrittlement is known to cause failure combined with static loads and when considered to work together with cyclic load it shortens componentâ€™s cycling durability significantly, that is estimation of its life found with fatigue cracking models is usually bigger than the more accurate one. This model helps to predict durability of a given sample with a relatively high accuracy taking into account (mode 1) only hydrogen embrittlement or (mode 2) both named factors.

The theoretical premises of the modelling technique implemented here as well as thorough treatment of the subject can be found in the following papers:
